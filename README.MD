# CyREST Framework

This is the base repository for implementing REST API tests using the Cypress framework. Gherkin has been applied, and instead of the Page Object Model typically used for frontend, a JSON Model has been utilized.

OAuth2 authorization has also been implemented by default. When using it, ensure that login information is stored in environment variables, not in the repository code.
